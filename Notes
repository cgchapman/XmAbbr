XmAbbr – Notes

Markup representation:

Basic tag format is identifier (label) followed by “:” (no whitespace) followed by data content with no end tag. Indentation used for cosmetic presentation. Attributes and Elements have same format – except attributes preceded by “$” character - “$” character also used as namespace prefix separator instead of “:”

Down one level shown by “-” in front of label while number of levels up shown by “+” repeated for number of levels. Attributes are always at same level as owning element and follow element data while text between sub elements indicated by “$:” label.

The normal format of data is tokenised text which can have any amount of whitespace (space,tab,CR,LF) – on import leading and trailing whitespace is removed and any whitespace within the text replaced by a single space. The data can include the “:” character which can be escaped by repeating this (ie: “::” is used to represent a single “:”). 

Data which does not match this tokenised format is enclosed in either single or double quotes. Within a quoted string the enclosing quote character is escaped by being repeated. Quoted strings maybe used within tokenised data to include untokenised text. Multiple quoted strings may be used within a data section – with any amount of whitespace between these which is not imported (eg: the data is only what is in the quoted strings

Label formats are:

elementName:    DATA -  plain element without namespace prefix
nsPrefix$elementName: DATA  - element with namespace prefix
$attributeName:    DATA -  attribute without namespace prefix
$nsPrefix$attributeName: DATA  - attribute with namespace prefix
$: DATA – inter element text

Structure representation:

-[nsPrefix$]?elementName: DATA – new element within the previous element
+[+]*[nsPrefix$]?elementName: DATA – element at a higher level of nesting
