# **XmAbbr**
A lightweight abbreviated alternative serialisation format for XML structured data

An abbreviated format for XML structured data. The aim is for this to be lightweight and more human readable than XML. Plus to include support for direct export and import of JavaScript data objects - both to and from full XML and XmAbbr

At the moment mostly a learning exercise - Main stages are to:

1. Develop a  specification for the alternate XML syntax
2. Devise methodology and rules to allow mapping between XML structures and JavaScript objects
3. Develop import and export routines 

### Key Goals:

1.  Fully represent all XML features - including namespaces etc
2.  As far as possible allow JavaScript data types to be represented and preserved
